### Workflow of the Project
1. Create a branch on your own local repository
2. The data folders have been added so give a relative path to use the data
3. Work on jupyter notebooks and add the notebooks to your branch
4. Merging into the master will open a pull request which will be reviewed before adding into the master branch. This is to keep the master branch clean.
