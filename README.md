### Workflow of the Project
1. Create your own branch and work on your branch
2. The data folders have been added so give a relative path to use the data
3. Work on jupyter notebooks and add the notebooks to your branch
4. Merging into the master will open a pull request which will be reviewed before adding into the master branch. This is to keep the master branch clean.
5. Do not commit multiple features together. Keep the commits small and easy to rollback to.

** The branches will go through a review before getting merged into the master branch, this is to keep the master branch clean. **

### Naming conventions to be followed
